## Product Zones and Quantity Log

The idea is to divide the products into their zones. This zones are like folders that represent a place in reality where products are stored. When a  User with Editor capabilites uses the website they will be able to add quantity logs: The exant ammount of a certain product that they can see in the moment. This logs can represent rewrites, additions and / or subtractions of one or several products. 

## The hard part
Calculating large ammounts of logs into their correct result numbers based on their timestamp and zone.
